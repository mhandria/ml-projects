# Machine Learning Projects & Notes

This repository is a collection of projects and some notes that I have read from **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems"** by **Aurélien Géron**.  You can find his books [here](https://amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291).  
  
Most, if not all, of the code can be found in the book.  The main purpose of this repo is just for my personal reasons.
